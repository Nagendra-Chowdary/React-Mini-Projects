# React Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of mini projects built with React. Some are focused on practicing specific concepts, while others are small functional apps. Each project is designed to strengthen understanding of React fundamentals and improve hands-on coding skills.

The projects cover topics like components, props, state, hooks, event handling, conditional rendering, and UI patterns. They serve as quick references and practice material for anyone learning React.

Feel free to explore, learn, and build on top of these projects! ðŸš€

- **Lottery App** â€“ A simple app with a button that generates a random number. If the number is greater than 3, you win! Built using promises and state to update the UI.

- **To-Do List App** â€“ A task manager where you can add and delete tasks. Tasks are displayed in a grid of note-like boxes, inspired by Google Keepâ€™s layout.
